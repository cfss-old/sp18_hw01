Hello, my name is Eigen Aoki.

I'm a **MAPSS** student studying political theory. My thesis project looks at Guy Debord's *Society of the Spectacle* and compares it to today's political climate. It also asks what it means to be a "spectator" to politics through the works of Jacques Ranciere and Paulo Freire. 

I'm originally from Oak Park, IL, just 30 minutes from Hyde Park. My undergraduate was at the University of Southern California where I majored in International Relations and East Asian Languages and Cultures. 

###Hobbies and Misc.

I like watching movies so here are a couple movies I saw recently that I enjoyed in no particular order. 

1. Get Out
2. The Handmaiden
3. Perfect Blue

As the photo above suggests, I am also a musician. I play bass and the Japanese Taiko Drums as a part of the Tsukasa Taiko group. Here is our website: http://www.taikolegacy.com/

Nice to meeet you all!
