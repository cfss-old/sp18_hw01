## Introduction

I am Yali Peng, a *J.S.D.* student from **the law school**. I have only used R for statistical analysis and no more. 

-My Hobby\
  -I like reading and traveling. I traveled to Israel and Palestine this spring break, where I also go to the borderline with Syria. 
  
-My Research Interest\
  -I specialize in criminal justice. To complete my dissertation, I need to transform judgments into data, and I also need to learn more about programming and computing. After all, I have __little__ experience in computation!
