# Donghyun Kang's Biography

My name is Donghyun Kang, a 1st-year Ph.D. student in the department of sociology. I was born in **Seoul**, South Korea on Sep 25, 1989. I did my B.A. at Seoul National University majoring in Business Administration and shifted to sociology for master's degree at the same university. For my master's thesis, I analyzed how the tweets regarding the two social movement events - *the LGBT group's sitting in the City Hall of Seoul* and *the protests of laid-off workers of Ssangyong Motor* - both of which happened in South Korea in 2014. I completed my master's degree in Feb 2016 and Before coming to Chicago in Aug 2017, I worked as a research associate at Social Network Computing Center at Seoul National University for one and a half of years. I'm currently interested in how and when the new academic disciplines emerge. More specifically, I hope to figure out the societal conditions that cause *interdisciplinary studies* to emerge. 

* Research interests
  Sociology of Knowledge; Computational Social Science; Economic Sociology; Social Organization
