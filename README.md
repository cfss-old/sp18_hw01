# __Report of Process__

Since I had a guide to the syntax, this assignment seemed relatively straightforward. You simply click copy the repository from GitHub and clone it in RStudio on a new project. You then add the text to the README.md in R Markdown syntax. For the R Markdown syntax, I used [this website] (https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#examples). I did have to go back and check the course website to remind myself how to pull/push files between RStudio and GitHub.
