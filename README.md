# Marie's Biography
I am a graduate student in the MAPSS program at the University of Chicago, where I am concentrating in sociology. 

### Education and Work Experience
I received my BA in English from Grinnell College in Iowa. After graduating from Grinnell in 2012, I moved back to my hometown of Chicago, where I was the Communications and Development Coordinator at Working Bikes, a nonprofit that donates used bicycles locally and globally. After three years at Working Bikes, I moved to Salt Lake City, Utah, where I served as the Donor Services Manager at the Community Foundation of Utah before beginning MAPSS.
