## Eigen Aoki

Hello, my name is Eigen Aoki. I'm a **MAPSS** student studying political theory. My thesis project looks at Guy Debord's *Society of the Spectacle* and compares it to today's political climate. It also asks what it means to be a "spectator" to politics through the works of Jacques Ranciere and Paulo Freire. 

I like watching movies so here are a couple movies I saw recently that I enjoyed in no particular order. 

1. Get Out
2. The Handmaiden
3. Perfect Blue
