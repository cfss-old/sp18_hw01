Rachel Cundiff's Biography
--------------------------

I'm Rachel, a native Chicagoan in the MAPSS program here at UChicago concentrating in psychology/neuroscience. My thesis examines how certain psychological conditions, specifically depression and alexithymia, affect a patient's response to treatment for chronic pain. I have a beautiful kitten named Zelda who loves to run around my tiny apartment on the north side of the city. Here's a picture of her. I mean, just look at how beautiful she is!! ![Alt text](/path/to/Zelda4.jpg)

I went to Loyola University Chicago for undergrad, and I'm really excited that our men's basketball team is in the final four for the NCAA tournament. **GO RAMBLERS!**

+ Man in the High Castle
