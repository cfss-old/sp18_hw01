#Biography
My name is Taylor Laties and I am a fourth year undergraduate. I was born in New Jersey, but consider myself to be from Arizona, since I have lived there for the past 9 years (minus my time at school). Here is a picture of my favorite spot in the state:

I am majoring in **Public Policy** and minoring in **Creative Writing**. For my major thesis I am looking into the policy surrounding the Flint Water Crisis. I *love* trying new foods, watching movies, and hiking when I am not doing school work. Some of my favorite movies are:
*Harry Potter(s)
*Pride and Prejudice
*Atonement

I don't have any coding experience, except for a little bit of R use in an introductory statistics course. I am especially excited to learn how to do web scraping in order to do research with internet data.
