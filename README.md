# CFSS HW01: Hello, world!

I was born in Seoul, South Korea and grew up between Korea and Madison, WI. During my undergraduate studies, my academic passions took me halfway around the world -- to Latin America. I devoted a significant amount of time to field research in the following countries:  

+  Colombia  
+  Bolivia  
+  Peru  

Since graduating, I spent a year as a research assistant to a professor investigating the social and economic history of [provincial pre-Revolutionary France](http://histecon.fas.harvard.edu/visualizing/angouleme/).

All of these experiences inform my outlook as a master's student in the social sciences focusing on modern Korean history. I think it took a veritable trip around the world for me to be able to see the history of Korea in fresh light.
