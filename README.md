#Hi, my name is Sophia. 
![picture of me](pic of me for cfss.jpg)
I am a second year political science student in the college. I am considering double majoring, but my double major tends to change every week - from psychology to linguistics to creative writing, etc. I am from New York City, specifically Brooklyn. 
##A few things I'm involved in:
I work at the [Chicago Project on Security and Threats](https://cpost.uchicago.edu/) and run a database on individuals in the US indicted for ISIS crimes. The study of conflict, terrorism, and gender are particular focuses of mine. I am heavily involved in the **Women’s Ultimate Frisbee Team**, a competitive club team here at UChicago. I am also the Research Director for UChicago’s international affairs club, MPOST. These are my main clubs, although I am involved in a few more. 
##Some random facts:
My apartment in Chicago has two cats:
1. Slops (short for Sloppy Joesephine)
2. Jack-o (like a jack-o-lantern). 
At home in Brooklyn, my cat is named T-Jeff, short for Thomas Jefferson *(don’t ask, I was 8)*. One of my favorite foods is sushi, and one of my favorite colors is crimson. My favorite childhood cartoon was Cyberchase, and my favorite book series was Tintin. These are random facts, and if you would like to get to know me more, my email is *sophiakierstead@gmail.com*!
