My name is **Jason** and I *love* frisbee and *CS*. I have never used Github but this is a cool photo ![GitHub Logo](/images/logo.png)

Also this is a Yaktocat

Here is a list of how I learned to do this asssignment 

* First I went to class
  * There I talked to the TAs and professor about how to use RStudio and commit
* Then I went onti the class website 
  * Then went [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to learn about markdown
  * Then had a good time playing around with it
