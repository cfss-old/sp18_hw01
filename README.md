## Introduction

# Hello, my name is *Clara Sava-Segal*. This biography will consist of the following:
  
* Background
* Course of Study and Interests
* Plans post-graduation

**Background:**
I am currently a fourth year in the College at the University of Chicago, but I grew up right outside of [New York City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City). 

**Course of Study and Interests:**
As an undergrad, I've studied *Psychology* and *Comparative Human Development* and minored in *Biology.* I'm interested in the intersection between education and cognitive development and I worked in the [Casasanto Lab](http://www.casasanto.com), where I looked at the effects of different experiences on cognition. I am also currently working at a high school called Gary Comer College Prep.

When I graduate, I will be moving to Palo Alto in California.
