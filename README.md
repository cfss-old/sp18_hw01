### Hijo Byeun
## biography

Hi, my name is Hijo Byeun and I’m currently pursuing Masters Degree in Psychology and planning to graduate in spring. In my thesis, I’m working on the parent-child interactions around math. In my undergrad, I also studied psychology and worked in various labs. 
My previous labs: 
1. Metacognition Lab at Columbia University
2. Cognitive Lab at Ajou University in S. Korea
After graduation, I'm planning to go back to S. Korea for a while to spend sometime with my family. I will miss hyde park., although I have only been here less than a year.  
In my personal time, I like to travel around countries or within the States. Most recently I’ve made my first trip to Europe, specifically Brussels and Paris. The picture on the bottom of the page is me in the **Grand Place** in Brussels. Although this is my first data science class at UChicago, I’m excited to learn R and apply it to my research.

This is a list of places I’ve traveled within the States:
*Orlando
*Boston
*Washington DC
