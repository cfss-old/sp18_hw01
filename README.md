## About Me

I grew up in southern Mississippi and went to college at **Louisiana State University**. After college, I ran an outreach program through Baton Rouge Parks and Recreation aimed at increasing engagement with underserved members of the community. 

My current interests include:
* Urban land use policies
* Architecture
* Historic preservation 
* Community engagement 

My current work is on the [Pullman Neighborhood](https://www.nps.gov/pull/index.htm) on the South Side of Chicago
