# A Biography of Diego Cardenas

### Basic Information
I am a **fourth-year sociology major** in the college, and I was born and raised in **Phoenix, Arizona.** I want to go to graduate school some day to pursue a PhD in **Sociology**, but I plan on taking a few gap years for now. I'm not a big fan of extremely hot and dry weather, but it's not like I like Chicago's winters either.

Here's a cool look at a project I did for an urbanism/urban sociology class that I took here: [Mapping Little Village](https://hoodmapping.org/little-village/)
