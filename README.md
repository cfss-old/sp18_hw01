## Description of Process

After I cloned the repository to my computer, I directly edited the README.md file in RStudio. I added text, making sure to include headers, lists, bold font, and an image. I struggled with inserting an image because I wasn't sure where I needed to store the actual jpg file on my computer in order for RStudio to find it, but I eventually figured it out. After using the preview function to ensure my file looked right, I will commit my changes to my repo and push the commit to GitHub. Under the Git tab, there are 7 different files, and I'm not sure if all of them need to be committed to my repo. My plan is to only commit and push the README.md file so hopefully that will work.

#### Helpful Tutorials/Websites
For an introduction of R Markdown basics, I found [this website](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html) most helpful. In terms of learning how to create bold/italics text, lists, headers, and insert images, I relied heavily on both the markdown cheatsheat provided in class and the [github mastering markdown guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
