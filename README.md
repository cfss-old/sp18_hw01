# __Report of Process__

Since I had a guide to the syntax, this assignment seemed relatively straightforward. You simply create a fork on the HW repository, copy the repository from GitHub and clone it in RStudio on a new version control project. You then add the text to the README.md in R Markdown syntax. For the R Markdown syntax, I used [this website](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#examples). I did have to go back and check the course website to remind myself how to pull/push files between RStudio and GitHub. Once I saved the changed I made to README.md, I committed them, added a note, and pushed them to the repository on GitHub. The only issue I had was that I didn't create a fork at first, so I had to go back and create a new project under the forked repository. I also have a few revisions where I fixed typos.
