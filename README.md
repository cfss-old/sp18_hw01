## Description of Process

After I cloned the repository to my computer, I directly edited the README.md file in RStudio. I added text, making sure to include headers, lists, bold font, and an image. I struggled with inserting an image because I wasn't sure where I needed to store the actual jpg file on my computer in order for RStudio to find it, but I eventually figured it out. After using the preview function to ensure my file looked right, I committed my changes to my repo and pushed the commit to Github. Under the git tab, there were 7 different files. I was unsure if I should commit and push all 7 files or if I only needed to commit the README.md file. Originally, I pushed only the README.md file. However, after looking at it on github, I realized my image was no longer showing up so I went back and also commit and pushed my image file to Github. After updating my process description to reflect this, I will commit my new changes to the README.md file and push to Github. 

#### Helpful Tutorials/Websites
For an introduction of R Markdown basics, I found [this website](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html) most helpful. In terms of learning how to create bold/italics text, lists, headers, and insert images, I relied heavily on both the markdown cheatsheat provided in class and the [github mastering markdown guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
