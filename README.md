My name is Stephanie Ternullo. I am a First-Year PhD Student in the **Sociology Department**, interested in political sociology. I'm planning to use geospatial techniques to model changes in voting outcomes by county in the U.S. from the 1950s to the present. You can find my profile on the Sociology Department [website](https://sociology.uchicago.edu/directory/stephanie-ternullo). I am originally from Connecticut, but I am coming to Chicago most recently from a job in Washington, D.C.

My academic background is a bit varied. In the past, I have studied:  
1. Economics at Amherst College, *B.A*    
2. Economic and Social History at Cambridge University, *M.Phil*

I'm really enjoying my time at UChicago thus far, and I'm excited to learn more about good data science practices through R during this course.
