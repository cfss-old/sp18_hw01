### About David
I look at the world in an analytical way. Deconstructing complex issues and seeing how all the little parts interact is really cool. That's why I'm curious about social science research. Computer science and statistics provide useful tools to analyze these issues. Oh and by the way I love dogs. Especially golden retrievers.

### David's Activities
At the University of Chicago, I am involved in the Paul Douglas Institute, the Citizen Bulletin, and the Maroon. Check out this article I wrote for the Maroon:
