# About Me

I am a **MAPSS** student concentrating in **Political Science**. Before coming to University of Chicago, I have worked in both *Economics* and *Political Science* departments. My research interests thus blur the lines between the two disciplines and can be summarized into three main sub-fields:

* Economic History
* Political Economy
* Game Theory

Outside of research, my main hobbies are:

* Hiking
* Powerlifting
* Pokemon Go

# Thoughts
At first I found Github and markdown rather complicated. Inititially, I had problems using the Github Bash/GUI to commit changes. Also, I have expierence coding in R but have never used markdown. There was a little bit of a learning curve. I hope these added complexities pay-off.
