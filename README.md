# Golnar Babakhani Teimouri

## Background
I was born and raised in Iran. When I was a sophomore in college, I joined millions of other Iranians to  protest the fraudulent result of 2009 presidential election. In this very unclear [photo](photo.jpg), I am one of the girls on top of the university gates. A very clear version of this photo and even more clear videos led to my expulsion 'due to political activism against the government'. So, I left Iran and my family and moved to the U.S. by myself (**not fun!**). 

## Academic Interests
I got into college in Iran for chemical engineering, did French Literature instead, and switched to sociology for undergrad in the United States. I am now getting my master degree in political science! I am specifically interested in:

* Racial politics
* Social media and public opinion
* Congress



##A Fun Fact About Iran##
Unlike most of my friends, I love Chicago weather. I am used to 4 seasons. YES, I am from the Middle East and we *do have snow* in many parts of my country. In fact, in 2016, CNN travel called Iran [the next ski destination](https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/iran-ski-dizin-damavand-silk-road/index.html). [This ski piste](http://www.damawand.de/Ski/Tochal.html) is exactly 6.02 miles away from my family's apartment.
