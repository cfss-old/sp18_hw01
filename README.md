### The Brief Biography of Khwan Kim ###
Before coming to Chicago, Khwan Kim worked as a broadcast journalist for major TV stations over nine years in South Korea. While his coverage was mainly focused on investigative journalism such as **crimes**, **corruption**, and **major disasters**, Kim also took a charge of an anchor in the Morning News for *Channel A*, one of the TV stations he worked for. 
The case to which he most devoted was the capsized Sewol Ferry disaster, the worst accident on the ferry to hit Korea in its history. More than 300 people on the ferry lost their lives including approximately 200 high school students who was on their field trip. This is one of the stories he covered back then ([link to the clip](https://vimeo.com/193540278)). 
He, however, began purusing more scientific curiosity. What he wanted to try is to look into the world from the perspective of Social Science with the use of computational methods. He believes taking Computing for the Social Sciences would be one of the ways to lead him to the goal. 
Now, his research interests are as follows: 

+  Media effect on society. 
+  Social network analysis. 
+  computational music analysis.
