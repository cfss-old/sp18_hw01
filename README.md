My name is Simon Yamawaki Shachter and I am currently a first-year PhD student at the University of Chicago studying Sociology. My research interests center on the role of philanthropy in the United States. Given my backgroudn in statistics and math, I am interested in using computational and statistical techniques to develop insights into the under-researched field of philanthropy.

I was born on May 3rd, 1992, the very **best** day of the year, in Stanford, California. Both of my parents worked for Stanford University and I grew up on campus. Not _just_ on campus - my parents were the resident fellows of a dorm there, so I grew up with 100 undergraduates as my neighbors, all of whom refreshed every year. I experienced a very privileged childhood in a wealthy suburb, followed by a privilege time at University and brief time working in the nonprofit world in San Francisco before beginning my PhD.

In addition to my role at the university, I am also the co-founder and board chair of a nonprofit called [YCore](https://www.ycore.org). YCore mobilizes an untapped generation of young professionals and equips them with the tools to impact their communities for the rest of their lives. We're only about two years old at this point, but have experienced exponential growth through that time, and I am hoping it soon becomes far too big for me to be able to be so intimately involved while doing my doctoral work.
