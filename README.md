# Short Bio on Tarryn Rennie 
### I decided that for this assignment I was going to tell you **15 things** that you wouldn't know just from meeting me, instead of just the usual tired-out blurb. 
1. I am a Zimbabwean, born and raised. 
1. I almost qualified the 2016 Olympics for my national team, falling just short. 
1. I swam in college but retired after my collegiate career was done. I am now a "swammer."
1. I have a cat, Addie, who I found in a dumpster last January and decided I couldn't part with (much to my former roommates' consternation). My current roommate's name is also Addye, and it is as confusing as it sounds.  
1. I had wanted a dog, so decided to try train her... Needless to say, it didn't go well BUT she does come when I whistle, which is pretty cool. She is the best and is currently sitting on my lap trying to distract me. 
1. I can draw and paint. I really like doing portraiture. 
1. I have one sibling, a brother named Piers. We are always mistaken for each other. I am often called sir, and he is called "ma'am," and yes, we don't know why. 
1. My favourite book is called *"The Power of One."* I highly recommend it. 
1. I don't really like movies. They're too long and I get bored half way through. 
1. Saying that, my guilty pleasure are shows like *"The Good Wife,"* or *"Homeland."*
1. I am currently trying to learn French. 
1. If I could change one thing about myself, I would give myself some musical talent. 
1. I love to cook, though I always take liberties with a recipe. Sometimes it works. Sometimes... not so much. 
1. When I was growing up, I wanted to be a fighter pilot. This was until I realised I have far from perfect vision, and I get motion sick. 
1. Finally, I absolutely *love* stationery. It's a problem and I am convinced I keep the Hyde Park Target afloat on pen sales alone.
